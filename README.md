# Computational Neuroscience Project Skeleton

This repository is a skeleton Python package that students in PSYC 5270 can use to get started on their data exploration assignments.

Start by cloning the repository: `git clone https://github.com/melizalab/comp-neurosci-skeleton.git`

This will create a new directory, `comp-neurosci-skeleton`, containing the following items:

- `README.md`: this file
- `setup.py`:  package description file. You will need to edit this.
- `requirements.txt`: a list of packages your code depends on
- `.gitignore`: a list of files git will ignore when telling you what's changed
- `src`:       a directory where you will put your python code
- `test`:      a directory where you will put test code
- `data`:      a directory where your data will live
- `build`:     a directory where processed output from your analysis will live

Choose a new name for your package. Rename the top-level directory (`comp-neurosci-skeleton`) and edit `setup.py` to set the new name and other identifying information.

Now you need to create a github repository of your own. Go to [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new). Give the repository your chosen name and a description, then click Create Repository. Make a note of the address of your repository. It will look something like `https://github.com/dmeliza/dummy.git`

Finally, set your local directory to track the github repository by running the following commands in your working directory. Replace the repository address in the code below with the one for your project.

``` shell
git remote rm origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/dmeliza/dummy.git
git push -u origin master
```

Eventually you'll want to edit this file to describe your actual project.
